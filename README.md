## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended for Local Development)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maheswara192/superstore-analytics-portfolio.git
   cd superstore-analytics-portfolio
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose** (one command!):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access the dashboard**:
   - Open your browser to: **http://localhost:8501**
   - The database will be automatically created on first run

4. **Stop the application**:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal, then run:
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Docker Commands Reference

```bash
# Build and run in detached mode (background)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose up --build

# Remove all containers and volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

### Troubleshooting Docker

- **Port already in use**: Change the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml` from `8501:8501` to `8502:8501`
- **Database issues**: Run `docker-compose down -v` to remove volumes and start fresh
- **Build errors**: Ensure Docker has enough memory allocated (Settings → Resources → Memory: 4GB+)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (Professional Grade)

This project has been upgraded from a simple script to a production-ready **Data Intelligence Pipeline**:

1.  **Data Persistence**: RAW CSV data is migrated to a **SQL (SQLite)** backend via `setup_database.py`.
2.  **BI Engine**: The Streamlit dashboard fetches data using **SQL Queries**, simulating corporate data environments.
3.  **Prescriptive Analytics**: Implemented a **Price Elasticity Model** to simulate the ROI of business strategy changes.
4.  **Enterprise Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 20+ unit tests, edge cases, and integration tests.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🏢 Module 1: Executive ROI Simulator (Level Up!)
*Most candidates show what happened. This tool shows what *should* happen.*
- **Objective**: Optimize profitability by simulating discount caps.
- **Logic**: Uses a simulated Price Elasticity model (Impact of Price on Volume).
- **Business Impact**: Identifies the exact "Sweet Spot" where reducing discounts increases profit without losing critical sales volume.

### 🎯 Module 2: RFM Customer Segmentation
- **Objective**: Categorize 700+ customers into strategic levels (Champions, At Risk, Regular).
- **Methodology**: Quintile-based scoring (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
- **Business Impact**: Enables targeted CRM campaigns (e.g., "Win-back" emails for At-Risk VIPs).

### 🔮 Module 3: Advanced Forecasting
- **Methodology**: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing.
- **Business Impact**: Predicts seasonal peaks (Q4 surges) with 90%+ statistical confidence.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Engineering

- **SQL**: SQLite3 (Data Engineering & Transformation)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Executive Dashboarding)
- **Analytics**: Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels (Advanced Forecasting)
- **Quality**: Pytest (Automated Data Integrity Checks)
